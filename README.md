# CAVE Language

This is the code for the [CAVE Language website](http://www.cavelanguage.org). CAVE is the Conversational Architecture Visual Expression language - a visual design language for describing contextual applications.

The website itself is nothing too special, it's just a Django app that uses [Axilent ACE](http://www.axilent.com/ace/) to manage its back end.
